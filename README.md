# SOD_DensityMod
A mod that allows you to set the density and land value range for city generation. With an in-game menu in the City Generation screen


# Release 1.4

### New "Land Value" settings!

Land value seems to affect how rich a block is, though more testing is needed, this seems to affect what buildings spawn.

### Now Open Source!

#### Changes:

- Added new Land Value setting that can be tweaked
- Fixed some typos present in Config file(I was very tired when writing it)
- Major overhauls under the hood for expandability, and readability
- Now open source!

# Installation: 

Install BepInEx IL2CPP-6.0.667 or later
Place the DensityMod.dll file into "Shadows of Doubt\BepInEx\plugins". Run the game!

# Notes: 

This mod allows you to set the density and land value range for city generation. With an in-game menu in the City Generation screen 

# Disclaimer: 

This modification does not hold any warranty or guarantee. Generating higher density cities can cause long load times, and other issues not known. It could also break stuff I'm not aware of.
