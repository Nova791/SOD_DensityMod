# Notes: 

This mod allows you to set the density and land value range for city generation. With an in-game menu in the City Generation screen 

# Disclaimer: 

This modification does not hold any warranty or guarantee. Generating higher density cities can cause long load times, and other issues not known. It could also break stuff I'm not aware of.
